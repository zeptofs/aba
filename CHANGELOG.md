## v1.0.0, 12 July 2020

### BREAKING CHANGES

- Positive (`n`) and negative (`-n`) values are now treated the same. e.g `5`
  and `-5` are both processed as `5`, without any signage. To differentiate
  between a debit and credit, use the correct [Transaction
  Code](https://github.com/andrba/aba/blob/58446f5b0ef822e9792e9399b4af647319b13515/lib/aba/transaction.rb#L106-L112)
- Removed default values for transactions records to avoid generation of
  potentially incorrect records. Safety first!
- Minimum Ruby version is now 2.5

### NEW FEATURE

- You can now add a *return* record to be used when you'd like to return a
  credit or a debit to another financial institution (OFI).
